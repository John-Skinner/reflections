When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

 I would want to use a remote repository rather than keeping my work local when i want to collaborate
 with someone else on a software project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    I may be in the middle of development and don't want to have 
    my sources change at this time.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    fork is a clone but only in the remote repository
    clones are copies of a repository only on the local computer
    branches is the start of a different line of changes which 
    fork and clone can copy

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

	Withthe last known state of the remote stored locally, i can
	work off-line and still be able to re-sync with the remote
	repository.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

	We could pass around files to collaborate without git or github.


When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

 I would want to make changes on a separate branch when i'm working on something from a larger community.
Then my changes can be reviewed by others before they go into master.

If i'm only working alone or mostly alone, then it is simpler to 
use the master directly.
