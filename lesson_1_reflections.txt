How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
it hightlighted just the changed lines.
How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

I can see when features were added.
What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

I might forget, and loose my local file.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

By saving multiple files in one commit, you don't need to remember what files are important to the overall change.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

The git log can show the change id's needed for the diff command.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

Version control increases my confidance to make changes that could break something because i know i can very quickly revert to an older version.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

Completing the course.
